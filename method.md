# Method

overview:

* based on Osterwalder, Value proposition design
* create a customer profile for each phase, based on (1) results of questionnaire and (2) general knowledge of research
* create a value map for each phase, based on the customer profiles

We wrote this advice using the method of 'Value proposition design', as described by Osterwalder et al. First, we created for each phase a customer profile that describes:

1. the jobs that a customer needs to do
2. pains
3. gains

As input for these profiles we used:

1. the subdivision of research phases from the metadata of the complete tool list that was used in '101 innovations'
2. general knowledge of doing research
3. information on tools used in each phase, based on the results from the 101 questionnaire. Our presupposition is that tools that are popular apparently provide gains for researchers doing a specific job that they find important. Some of these gains are trivial, but not all. For example, ResearchGate being used in the Discovery phase suggests that it is important for researchers to be able to get quick access to a publication, but also that it is important to get information about the author of a publication.
